Building Theorafile for Windows
-------------------------------
Theorafile uses Visual Studio 2010 to build on Windows.

Dependencies
------------
Before building, download SDL3's VC development libraries from SDL's website:

http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

Extract the ZIP file's SDL3 directory (called something like 'SDL3-3.2.0') as
a sibling to your FNA3D checkout and rename it to 'SDL3', so that you have
directories named 'FNA3D' and 'SDL3' next to each other.

Compiling
---------
1. Build Theorafile/visualc/libtheorafile.sln
2. Grab the output DLL along with SDL3.dll, ship it!
